# Library-Management-System

The **Library Management System** is a robust desktop application built using Java and MySQL, leveraging the JDBC API to ensure seamless database interaction. The system is designed to manage key operations in a library environment with three primary database tables: `admin`, `books`, and `staff`.

- **Admin Table**: Manages and stores administrator credentials, providing secured access to various functionalities.
- **Books Table**: Keeps track of the library's book inventory, allowing for efficient operations like displaying available books, adding new books, and removing books that are no longer in circulation.
- **Staff Table**: Stores details of the working staff, supporting functionalities such as displaying staff details, hiring new staff, and terminating staff members.

The system is designed to streamline library management processes, improving productivity and organization by centralizing book and staff data.

### Key Features:
1. **Displaying Books**: View all books available in the library.
2. **Adding/Removing Books**: Administrators can easily update the libraryâ€™s inventory by adding or removing books.
3. **Displaying Staff Details**: View and manage all staff members, including their personal details and employment status.
4. **Hiring/Firing Staff**: Simplify the process of managing library staff by adding new hires or updating staff status.
5. **Editing Admin Credentials**: Administrators can change/update their credentials based on various criteria.
